# simpleChat

A test project consisting of an Express API that coordinates messages between different users using socket.io and SQL.
A user logs in, undergoes a series of validations, and then can send messages to another user.
MySQL creation and loading commands are provided to run the API locally.

1) Create the database in MySQL using the file db/social_api.sql
2) git clone https://github.com/moccodevs/simpleChat.git
3) cd simpleChat
4) npm start

# By default, access the application at localhost:3000 in the browser.
# Test logins with pre-created users are:
user1/pass1
user2/pass2
user3/pass3
